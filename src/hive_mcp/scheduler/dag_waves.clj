(ns hive-mcp.scheduler.dag-waves
  "DAGWave Scheduler — self-scheduling Forja Belt via KG dependencies.

   Uses KG `depends-on` edges as a DAG to determine task dispatch order.
   Automatically dispatches lings for ready tasks and re-dispatches when
   tasks complete, creating a self-scheduling execution loop.

   Data Flow:
   1. Coordinator feeds plan → plan-to-kanban → creates kanban tasks + KG depends-on edges
   2. DAGWave scheduler queries: kanban todos WHERE all depends-on targets have status=done
   3. Scheduler spawns lings for frontier tasks (up to max-slots)
   4. On :ling/completed event → mark kanban done → re-query frontier → auto-spawn
   5. Repeat until DAG empty or user says stop

   Key building blocks (all pre-existing):
   - plan/tool.clj: compute-waves (Kahn's algo), creates KG depends-on edges
   - edges.clj: get-edges-from with relation filter for :depends-on
   - agent/ling.clj: create-ling! with kanban-task-id linking
   - memory-kanban.clj: Chroma-based kanban CRUD
   - hivemind.clj: shout! for coordinator notifications
   - channel.clj: subscribe! for event listening (core.async pub/sub)

   SOLID: SRP - Pure scheduling logic, delegates to existing subsystems.
   CLARITY: L - Layers stay pure; scheduler only orchestrates."

(comment
  ;; Typical usage:
  ;; 1. Coordinator creates plan and runs plan-to-kanban
  ;; 2. Start the DAG scheduler:
  (start-dag! "plan-memory-id-here"
              {:cwd "/home/lages/PP/hive/hive-mcp"
               :max-slots 5
               :presets ["ling"]})

  ;; 3. Monitor progress:
  (dag-status)

  ;; 4. Stop when done:
  (stop-dag!)

  ;; Manual completion test (simulates a ling finishing):
  (on-ling-complete {:agent-id "swarm-test-123"
                     :project-id "hive-mcp"
                     :data {:result "success"}})

  ;; Find ready tasks manually:
  (find-ready-tasks "/home/lages/PP/hive/hive-mcp" #{} {} #{}))
