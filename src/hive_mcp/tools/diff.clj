(ns hive-mcp.tools.diff
  "Diff-based workflow tools for drone agents — facade module.

   This namespace re-exports all public vars from the diff sub-modules
   for backward compatibility. New code should require specific sub-modules:

   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.state       — atoms, TDD status
   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.compute     — pure diff computation
   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.validation  — path validation
   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.auto-approve — approval rules
   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.handlers    — core MCP handlers
   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.wave        — wave batch operations
   - hive-mcp.tools.diff.batch       — multi-drone batch operations

   Workflow:
   1. Drone calls propose_diff with old/new content and description
   2. Hivemind reviews with list_proposed_diffs (sees metadata only)
   3. If needed, get_diff_details shows hunks for inspection
   4. Hivemind calls apply_diff (applies change) or reject_diff (discards)

   Token-Efficient Three-Tier API (ADR 20260125002853):
   - Tier 1: list_proposed_diffs -> metadata + metrics only (~200 tokens/diff)
   - Tier 2: get_diff_details -> formatted hunks (~500 tokens/diff)
   - Tier 3: apply_diff -> uses stored full content internally"
