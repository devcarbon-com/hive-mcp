(ns hive-mcp.tools.swarm.wave.phases
  "Phase-based wave execution orchestration.

   Extracted from wave.clj execute-wave! to reduce complexity
   (SOLID-S: Single Responsibility, cc < 15 per phase).

   Phases:
   1. pre-flight  - Validation, claim cleanup, cost tracking
   2. register    - Edit registration, dependency inference
   3. batching    - Compute conflict-free batches
   4. execute     - Batch-by-batch with bounded concurrency
   5. complete    - Metrics, status updates
   6. cleanup     - Always runs (transient state reset)

   Each phase is a pure function or has clear side-effect boundaries.
   The orchestrator (run-wave!) composes them with proper error handling."
