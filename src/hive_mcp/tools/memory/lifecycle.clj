  "Lifecycle handlers for memory entry duration management.

   SOLID: SRP - Single responsibility for entry lifecycle.
   CLARITY: Y - Yield safe failure with boundary handling.

   Handlers:
   - set-duration: Explicitly set duration category
   - promote: Move to longer duration
   - demote: Move to shorter duration
   - cleanup-expired: Remove expired entries
   - expiring-soon: List entries expiring within N days
   - decay: Scheduled time-based staleness decay (W2)
