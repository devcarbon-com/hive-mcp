  "Migration handlers for memory project and storage transitions.

   SOLID: SRP - Single responsibility for data migration.
   CLARITY: Y - Yield safe failure with careful migration handling.

   Handlers:
   - migrate-project: Move entries between project IDs
   - import-json: Import from legacy JSON storage to Chroma
   - detect-orphaned-scopes: Find hash-based scope tags that need migration
   - migrate-scope: Migrate entries from old hash scope to new name scope

   Orphaned Scope Problem:
   Project-id derivation changed from hash-based to name-based:
   - Old: scope:project:d987697ae05f40b1 (hash)
   - New: scope:project:funeraria (name)

   Old entries exist but queries don't find them because scope tags don't match."
