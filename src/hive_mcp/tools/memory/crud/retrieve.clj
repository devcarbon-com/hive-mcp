  "Retrieval operations for memory: get-full, batch-get, check-duplicate, update-tags.

   SOLID: SRP - Handles only single-entry and batch retrieval operations.
   CLARITY: L - Layers stay pure with clear domain separation.

   Handlers:
   - handle-get-full: Get full entry by ID (with optional KG edges)
   - handle-batch-get: Get multiple entries by IDs
   - handle-check-duplicate: Check for existing content
   - handle-update-tags: Update tags on existing entry

   Knowledge Graph Integration:
   - get-full returns kg_outgoing and kg_incoming edges when present
   - batch-get includes KG edges per entry"
