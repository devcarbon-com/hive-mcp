  "Persistent asyncio event loop management for SDK sessions (P3-T2).

   Each SDK session gets a dedicated asyncio event loop running in a
   background daemon thread. This enables multi-turn dispatch by keeping
   the async context alive across query() calls.

   Lifecycle: start-session-loop! -> connect-session-client! ->
              [query() calls] -> disconnect-session-client! -> stop-session-loop!"
