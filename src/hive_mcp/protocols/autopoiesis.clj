  "Protocol definitions for self-creating knowledge systems.

   IAutopoiesis: Interface between hive-mcp (open) and hive-knowledge (proprietary).
   Defines a system that creates and maintains itself - the defining
   characteristic of living systems (Maturana & Varela, 1972).

   The protocol enables systems that:
   1. Observe - query with awareness of their own state
   2. Learn - extract knowledge from exploration
   3. Emerge - detect patterns not explicitly taught
   4. Decay - apply entropy, prune what's no longer valid
   5. Cross-pollinate - transfer learning across boundaries
   6. Self-modify - adapt own parameters based on performance
   7. Track adaptation - maintain history and score of self-modifications

   IIntrospect: Companion protocol for explaining system behavior.
   Enables transparency, debuggability, and health monitoring of
   autopoietic processes.

   SOLID-I: Interface segregation - autopoietic operations only.
   SOLID-D: Depend on abstraction, not specific implementations.
   CLARITY-L: Layers stay pure - protocol is the boundary between
              core hive-mcp and knowledge enhancement implementations.")

(defprotocol IAutopoiesis
  "Protocol for self-creating knowledge systems.

   Autopoiesis (Greek: auto = self, poiesis = creation/production) describes
   systems that create and maintain themselves. This protocol defines the
   interface for knowledge systems that can:

   - Observe their environment with structural awareness
   - Learn from territory exploration
   - Emerge new patterns from existing knowledge
   - Decay stale knowledge via entropy
   - Cross-pollinate insights across boundaries
   - Self-modify parameters based on observed performance
   - Track and score adaptation effectiveness

   Implementations:
   - BasicAutopoiesis: No-op fallback (hive-mcp default)
   - EnhancedAutopoiesis: Full implementation (hive-knowledge)

   The protocol allows hive-mcp to function independently while enabling
   enhanced capabilities when hive-knowledge is available."

  (observe [this query opts]
    "Query with structural awareness and staleness checks.

       query - Natural language or structured query
       opts  - Map with optional keys:
               :scope       - Project scope filter
               :types       - Entry types to include

       :gaps       - Identified knowledge gaps
       :staleness  - Map of entry-id -> staleness probability
       :suggestions - Recommended follow-up queries

     The observe operation is awareness-augmented - it considers not just
     content match but the system's understanding of its own knowledge state.")

  (trust? [this entry]
    "Evaluate whether an entry should be trusted or needs re-grounding.

     Arguments:
       entry - Memory entry map

       :reasons      - Vector of trust/distrust reasons
       :action       - Recommended action (:use, :verify, :reground, :discard)

     Trust evaluation considers:

     - Time since last grounding
     - Knowledge gaps present")

     that wasn't explicitly programmed or stored.")

  (cross-pollinate [this entry-id]
    "Find isomorphic patterns across project boundaries.

     Arguments:
       entry-id - Source entry to find analogues for

     Returns:

       :transferable? - Boolean: can learning transfer?
       :adaptations - Suggested adaptations for cross-project use

     Cross-pollination enables learning from one domain to transfer to
     another, recognizing structural similarities despite surface differences.")

  (learn [this exploration-result]
    "Extract knowledge from territory exploration.

     Arguments:
       exploration-result - Map from code/file exploration:
                           :files-read - Files examined

     Arguments:
       None (operates on entire knowledge base)

       :promoted    - Count of entries promoted (high evidence)
       :demoted     - Count of entries demoted (low evidence)

     Decay is essential for autopoiesis - without entropy, the system

       :rollback-fn - Fn to undo this modification (or nil)

     Self-modification is the reflexive capability - the system adapting
     its own operating parameters based on observed performance.
