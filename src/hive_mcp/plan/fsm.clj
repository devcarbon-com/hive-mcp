(ns hive-mcp.plan.fsm
  "Plan lifecycle FSM using hive.events.fsm.

   Models the plan lifecycle as a deterministic finite state machine:

     draft → validated → approved → executing → completed

   Each transition has guards (predicates) and actions (side effects).
   plan-to-kanban is the :approved → :executing transition action.

   ## Usage

   ```clojure
   (require '[hive-mcp.plan.fsm :as plan-fsm])

   ;; Create a plan and advance through states
   (-> (plan-fsm/create-plan {:title \"My Plan\" :steps [...]})
       (plan-fsm/validate!)
       (plan-fsm/approve!)
       (plan-fsm/execute! {:directory \"/project\"}))
   ```

   ## Integration with hive.events.fsm

   The FSM spec is compiled once and reused. Resources inject
   memory/kanban/KG clients for side effects during transitions.

   SOLID-S: Plan lifecycle only.
   CLARITY-I: Guards validate at each transition boundary."
