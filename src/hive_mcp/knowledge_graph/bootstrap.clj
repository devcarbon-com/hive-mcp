  "Bootstrap KG edges from existing memory entries.

   Backfill KG edges for entries that predate the edge inference hook (P0.1).
   Applies the same inference rules as handle-add:
   - Tag overlap ≥ 3 → :refines edge (confidence = overlap/max-tags)
   - Content contains 'supersedes' + references entry ID → :supersedes
   - Content contains 'depends on' + references entry ID → :depends-on
   - Session summaries linked chronologically (N refines N-1)

   Bounded: max 200 entries, max 500 edges per run.
   Idempotent: skips if edge already exists between pair."

(defn backfill-edges-from-memory!
  "Bootstrap KG edges from existing memory entries.

   Queries all memory entries from Chroma and infers edges based on:
   1. Tag overlap ≥ 3 → :refines edge (confidence = overlap/max-tags)
   2. Content 'supersedes' + entry ID reference → :supersedes
   3. Content 'depends on' + entry ID reference → :depends-on
   4. Session summaries linked chronologically (N refines N-1)

   Options:
     :entry-limit  - Max entries to fetch (default: 200)
     :edge-limit   - Max edges to create (default: 500)
     :project-id   - Filter entries by project (default: all)
     :dry-run?     - If true, compute but don't create edges (default: false)

   Returns:
     {:total-entries  <n>
      :edges-created  <n>
      :edges-skipped  <n>
      :edges-errored  <n>
      :by-relation    {:refines <n> :supersedes <n> :depends-on <n>}
