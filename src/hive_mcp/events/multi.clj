(ns hive-mcp.events.multi
  "Pure orchestration layer using multimethods for event dispatch.

   Provides an extensible, multimethod-based event handling system that
   sits above the core event machinery (hive-mcp.events.core) and enables:

   1. **Open dispatch** — New event types via `defmethod`, no modification needed
   2. **Composable pipelines** — Chain orchestrations via `:next` / `:dispatch-n`
   3. **Cross-domain coordination** — Orchestrate flows spanning ling, wave, session, crystal
   4. **Pure handlers** — Orchestrators return effect maps, no side effects
   5. **Middleware** — Pre/post processing via `wrap-orchestrator`

   ## Architecture

   ```
   [event vector]
       │
       ▼
   orchestrate (defmulti, dispatch on event-id)
       │
       ▼
   {:effects {...}        ;; Side effects to execute
    :next    [:event ...]  ;; Optional: chain to next event
    :dispatch-n [...]      ;; Optional: fan-out to multiple events
    :halt?   true}         ;; Optional: stop pipeline (don't chain)
   ```

   ## Relationship to Existing Namespaces

   - **events/core.clj**: Low-level dispatch + interceptor chain. `multi` uses core for
     effect execution but provides a higher-level orchestration API.
   - **events/handlers.clj**: Domain-specific handlers (ling, wave, session, etc.).
     Registered via `reg-event`. `multi` can delegate to these or compose them.
   - **events/bridge.clj**: Legacy hook→event transformation (defmulti hook->event).
     `multi` is the next stage — what happens *after* transformation.
   - **events/effects.clj**: Concrete fx/cofx implementations.
     `multi` produces effect maps that effects.clj executes.

   ## Usage

   ```clojure
   ;; Define an orchestrator for a cross-domain flow
   (defmethod orchestrate :forge/cycle-complete
     [event]
     (let [{:keys [agent-id results]} (second event)]
       {:effects {:shout {:agent-id agent-id
                          :event-type :completed
                          :data results}
                  :log {:level :info
                        :message (str \"Forge cycle done: \" agent-id)}}
        :next [:kanban/sync {:project (get results :project)}]}))

   ;; Execute the orchestration
   (execute! [:forge/cycle-complete {:agent-id \"ling-1\" :results {...}}])
   ```

   SOLID: OCP — Open for extension via defmethod, closed for modification
   SOLID: SRP — Pure orchestration logic, no side effects
   CLARITY: Composition over modification — wraps core dispatch
   CLARITY: Represented intent — event-id drives orchestration selection"

(defn execute!
  "Execute an orchestration pipeline for the given event.

   1. Calls `orchestrate` multimethod to get the orchestration result
   2. Executes effects from the result via hive-events fx system
   3. Chains to `:next` event if present (and not `:halt?`)
   4. Fans out to `:dispatch-n` events if present

   Events that have registered handlers in core are dispatched there.
   Events only handled by orchestrate stay in the multi pipeline.

   Args:
   - event: Event vector like [:event-id data-map]

   Returns the orchestration result map (or nil if no orchestrator).

   Example:
   ```clojure

   Returns a future that will contain the orchestration result.
