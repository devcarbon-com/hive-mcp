(ns hive-mcp.tools.memory.plan-routing-test
  "Tests for plan type routing in CRUD and search handlers.

   Verifies that type='plan' entries are routed to the plans collection
   (hive-mcp-plans, OpenRouter, 4096 dims) instead of the default memory
   collection (hive-mcp-memory, Ollama, 768 dims).

   Test strategy:
   - Uses with-redefs to mock plans namespace functions
   - Verifies routing decisions (plan vs non-plan) without Chroma dependency
   - Tests: handle-add, handle-query, handle-search-semantic, handle-get-full, plan-to-kanban"
