  "Unit tests for project tree discovery and hierarchy.

   HCR Wave 3: Tests for descendant scope tag resolution.

   Tests cover:
   - build-project-tree: Constructs tree from flat entity list
   - get-descendants: BFS traversal to find all children
   - get-ancestors: Walk up the tree to find parents
   - get-descendant-scope-tags: Convert descendant IDs to scope tags
   - get-descendant-scopes: Get raw descendant project IDs"
